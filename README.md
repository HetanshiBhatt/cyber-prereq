# Web Service Architecture & Server Roles

## What is a Web Service?
A web service is an application that provides functionality over the internet using standardized communication protocols such as HTTP, SOAP, and REST.

### Components of Web Service Architecture:
- **Client**: Initiates a request to the web service.
- **Web Service**: Processes the request and returns a response.
- **Server**: Hosts the web service and manages incoming requests.

### Roles of Servers:
- **Hosting Web Services**: The server runs the web service code, making it accessible online.
- **Processing Requests**: It handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and generates responses.
- **Storage & Security**: The server often interacts with databases and ensures secure communication.

# RESTful vs. SOAP-based Web Services

| Feature          | RESTful Web Services                         | SOAP-based Web Services                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Protocol**    | Uses HTTP (stateless)                      | Uses an XML-based protocol                  |
| **Data Format** | Supports JSON, XML, HTML, and Plain Text  | Strictly XML                                |
| **Performance** | Faster due to lightweight data transmission | Slower due to XML processing overhead       |
| **Flexibility** | Highly adaptable and scalable              | Rigid due to strict standards and structure |
| **Security**    | Relies on HTTPS, OAuth, and other web security mechanisms | Built-in WS-Security for enhanced protection |
| **Ease of Use** | Simpler to implement and integrate        | More complex due to strict specifications   |
| **Use Case**    | Ideal for web and mobile applications      | Commonly used in enterprise systems requiring high security |

### Key Insights:
- RESTful services are lightweight, flexible, and commonly used in modern web and mobile applications.
- SOAP services offer robust security features but are more complex and have higher processing overhead.

## 3. Implementing & Deploying a Simple HTTP Web Service

### **Using Node.js (Express)**

#### **Installation:**
```bash
npm install express
```

#### **Create `server.js`**
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Home route
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "Welcome to the web service!" });
});

// Get user by ID
app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
    res.json({ userId: req.params.id, name: "John Doe" });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});


```

#### **Run the Node.js Server:**
```bash
node server.js
```

#### **Test API:**
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/hello`

---

## **Deployment Steps**
You can deploy your API using **Render, Railway, or AWS EC2**.


## **How to Push Code to GitHub**

#### **Initialize Git in Your Project**
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
```

#### **Add and Commit Files**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Added Flask/Node.js web service"
```

#### **Push Code to GitHub**
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
